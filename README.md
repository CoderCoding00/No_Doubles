# No Doubles Instructions  
```md 
Print the sum of two 6-sided dice rolls, each in the range ..6.
However, if noDoubles (the third value input) is true,
and, if the two dice show the same value, increment one die to the next value,
wrapping around to 1 if its value was 6.

Here are some examples.
• inputof 2,3,true -> 5
• inputof 3,3,true -> 7
• inputof 3,3,false -> 6
```
